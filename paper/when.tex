The categorical axiomatization presented in \cref{sec:how} is one approach of many
to the mathematical formalization of quantum computation. In this section
we will briefly touch on some of the past work relating to quantum computation
and speculate on future directions.

\subsection{Related Work} 

One of the first generic models for quantum computation was the Quantum
Turing Machine (QTM), introduced by \cite{deutsch1985}. His machine allows for superpositions
of machine states, mimicking the state of qubits, and is equivalent to the
quantum circuits used by physicists. With the presence of a universal quantum turing
machine, all quantum algorithms can be expressed formally in terms of QTMs. 

\cite{selinger2006lambda,selinger2009quantum} describe a higher-order quantum lambda 
calculus which  takes an important step in introducing abstraction of first-class 
quantum circuits.
Their calculus is equipped with a linear type system, which uses subtyping of the
exponentials to distinguish Newtonian from quantum values. The language introduces
a number of constants: $\texttt{new}$ for pure state preparation,
$\texttt{meas}$ for measurement, and constants corresponding to all unitary
transforamtions. The ability to introduce arbitrary unitary matrices is
important for expressing known quantum algorithms, but breaks the abstraction 
bewteen higher-order circuits and unitary matrices. \cite{abramsky2009categorical}
address this by expressing teleportation and other algorithms \emph{purely} in
category-theoretic terms, thereby eliminating the need for arbitrary unary matrices.

There are many attempts to develop usable quantum languages for future physical quantum
computers. \cite{omer2000quantum} developed the langauge QCL, which is a procedural
quantum language based on C. QCL can be used as a frontend for a quantum simulator,
although it is designed as a real language for quantum computers. Quipper,
developed by \cite{green13quipper}, 
it is a higher-order functional language embedded in Haskell. Compared to QCL,
Quipper formalizes the compilation of code to quantum circuits.
Both languages allow for effectful computation, limited recursion, and automatic
generation of quantum code from classical functions.

On the semantic side of quantum langauges, there is extensive work in denotational 
models of quantum computation. \cite{coecke2005kindergarten} presents an
explicit connection between quantum circuit diagrams and category theoretic 
commuting diagrams in what he calls ``Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics.''
Along a similar vein, \cite{abramsky2006categorical} present quantum logic,
of which there is a large body of work, in the world of category theory with
the goal of making quantum algorithms more expressible. That work is a precursor
to Abramsky's model described in \cref{sec:how}.

\subsection{Next steps}

The way forward for quantum computing depends in some sense on engineering. 
Physical quantum computers are still in their infancy, and the different 
engineering design choices that are made will influence the computing design choices.
The quest for feasable quantum computers is racing ahead day by day.
Researchers are able to factor larger and larger numbers using Shore's algorithm,
culminating in a factorization of 143 by \cite{xu2012quantum}.
In 2012 \citet{bao2012quantum} succeeded in performing the first large-scale teleportation
of qubits, across a distance of 150~meters.
There are even commercial products, such as D-Wave Systems \citep{johnson2011quantum}, which utilizes
quantum superpositions (although there is speculation over whether the D-Wave truly takes
advantage of the quantum properties, or is equivalent to a classical computer).
